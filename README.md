# Fully Tappd

Fullytappd is a loose clone of Untappd, a beer reviewing web application. Users can navigate the site viewing a single beer or brewery's page. On their respective pages, users can expect to see recent reviews on that beer/brewery as well as information such as their average rating and number of reviews.

There are two kinds of users: business and standard. A standard user is able to create a profile, view all beers and breweries while navigating the site, and leave a reviews on beers they are currently drinking. In addition to the latter, a business user can also create a brewery and beers associated to that brewery. If a user is not logged in, they only have the ability to view beers and breweries.

This project has been a testament to my pursuit of building upon my previous knowledge. Prior to my enrollment in App Academy, I spent time working in the beer and wine industries. This project proved to be an extension of those passions and I throughly enjoyed building out this application. I look forward to spending more time and further developing out additional feature such as user profiles, friends, favorites, and badges. I also plan on integrating AWS for image uploads and google maps api to find beer and breweries local to each user.
